# ci-recipes

ci-recipes is a repository of [ActiveData recipes][0]. A recipe is a small
snippet that runs one or more active data queries and returns the output. Queries can sometimes be
modified by command line arguments and output can sometimes be post-processed.

Each recipe should try to answer a single question.

# Installation

First [install poetry][2], then run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ahal/ci-recipes
    $ cd ci-recipes
    $ poetry install

You will need Python 3.7 or higher.

# Usage

The `poetry install` command will create a virtualenv with all of the required dependencies
installed. You can use `poetry run <cmd>` to run a single command within the virtualenv context. Or
you can use `poetry shell` to spawn a new shell with the virtualenv activated. The commands below
assume you have run the latter.

Run:

    $ adr <recipe> <options>

For a list of recipes:

    $ adr list

For recipe specific options see:

    $ adr recipe <recipe> -- --help

To serve the web app locally:

    $ adr-app

# Recipes

See the [recipe documentation][1] for more information on which recipes are available and how to run
them.

# Development

To contribute to `ci-recipes` first follow the installation steps above.
You can run tests with:

    $ poetry run tox

Or:

    $ poetry shell
    $ tox

# Troubleshooting

The `poetry install` command may lock up on Windows10 (Python3.7.6) you can get around this with:

    poetry export -f requirements.txt > requirements.txt
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
